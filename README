NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes - release tests for your
    changelog

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [ChangesTests]

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

        xt/release/cpan-changes.t - a standard Test::CPAN::Changes test

    See Test::CPAN::Changes for what this test does.

    You should use this plugin instead of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPANChangesTests because this one lets you cheat on
    the filename.

  Alternate changelog filenames
    CPAN::Changes::Spec specifies that the changelog will be called
    'Changes' - if you want to use a different filename for whatever reason,
    do:

        [ChangesTests]
        changelog = CHANGES

    and that file will be tested instead.
